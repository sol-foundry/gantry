# Homebrew formula, kept in this repo (the repo doubles as its tap):
#   brew tap sol-foundry/tap https://github.com/sol-foundry/gantry && brew trust --formula sol-foundry/tap/gantry && brew install gantry
# Homebrew loads formulas from outside its official repositories only once they're trusted.
# The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) updates url and sha256 for every release.
